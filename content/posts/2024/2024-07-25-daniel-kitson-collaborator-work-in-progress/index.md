## Collaborators

Last night we went to see
[Daniel Kitson's "_Collaborator_" (work in progress)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240720135250/https://www.thealbany.org.uk/shows/collaborator/).
I'd no idea what to expect but it was really good!

    class="captioned",

    alt="A photo of the central area of a small theatre in the round. There are
         four tiers of seating and then an upper balcony.Most seats are filled.
         The central stage area is empty except for four large stacks of
         paper.",

) }}

It has been reviewed at 4/5 stars in Chortle and positively in the Guardian,
but I don't recommend reading any reviews because they'll spoil what you will
experience. We went in to it blind as I always prefer that rather than
thorough research of a show. I think that was the correct decision. I've been
on Daniel's fan newsletter for ages but hadn't had chance to see him live
until now.

While I've seen some comedy gigs that resembled this, I've never seen anything
quite like it.

At £12 a ticket this is an absolute bargain. We spent more getting there by
public transport!

## Shout out to the nerds

If you're a casual comedy enjoyer looking for something a bit different then
that's all you need to know. If like me however you consider yourself a bit of
a wanky appreciator of comedy as an art form, I have some additional thoughts!

_Collaborator_ wasn't rolling-on-the-floor-in-tears funny, but was extremely
enjoyable and Jenny and I spent the whole way home debating how Kitson
designed it and what parts of it really meant. Not everyone wants that in
comedy, and that's fine. I don't always want it either. But to get it
sometimes is a rare treat.

It's okay to enjoy a McIntyre or
[Peter Kay crowd-pleaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hkEnZhaCsA) about
"do you have a kitchen drawer full of junk?" or "do you remember white dog
poo?" but it's also okay to appreciate something that's very meta and
deconstructive. Stewart Lee for example is often accused of being smug and
arrogant when he
[critiques the work of other comedians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW3ZADTaUJc&t=315s),
and his fans to some extent are also accused of enjoying feeling superior more
than they enjoy a laugh - and some of them who miss the point definitely _are_
like this.

But acts like Kitson and Lee are
[constructed personalities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w-K0NWtysA) where
what they claim to think and how they behave is a fundamental part of the
performance. You are to some extent _supposed_ to disagree with and be
challenged by their views and behaviours — and I don't just mean they are
edgelording with some "saying the things that can't be said" schtick.
Sometimes it's fun to actually have thoughts about it. It's a different but no
less valid (or more valid!) experience. A welcome one in this case!

I mean, I _might_ have to judge you if you enjoy
[Mrs Brown's Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rC2rfCj3sk&pp=ygUPbXJzIGJyb3ducyBib3lz),
but I accept it has an audience as an art form.

## White space

There was a comment
[on Fedi](https://social.bitfolk.com/@grifferz/112845249632129851) about how
the crowd pictured here appears to be a sea of white faces, despite London
being a fairly diverse city. This sort of thing hasn't escaped me. I've found
it to be the case in most of the comedy gigs I've attended in person, where
the performer is white. I don't know why. In fact, acts like Stewart Lee and
Richard Herring will frequently make reference to the fact that their
stereotypical audience member is a middle aged white male computer toucher
with lefty London sensibilities. So, me then.

Don't get me wrong, I do try to see some diverse acts and have been in a
demographic minority a few times. Sadly enough, just going to see a female act
can be enough to put you in an audience of mostly women. That happened when we
went to see
[Bridget Christie's _Who Am I?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25_q3C5lWDI)
("a menopause laugh a minute with a confused, furious, sweaty woman who is
annoyed by everything", 4 stars, Chortle), and it's a shame that people seem
to stick in their lanes so much.
