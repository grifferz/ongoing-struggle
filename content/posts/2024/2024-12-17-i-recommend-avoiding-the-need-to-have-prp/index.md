Yesterday I had panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser treatment in both
eyes, and it was quite unpleasant. I recommend trying really hard to avoid
having to ever have that if possible.

PRP is used to manage symptoms of proliferative [diabetic retinopathy]. A laser
is used to burn abnormal new blood vessels around the retina.

Having had a different kind of laser treatment before I wasn't expecting this
to be a big deal. Unfortunately I was wrong and it was a bit of an ordeal.

As usual at these eye examinations I had drops to dilate my pupils and a bunch
of different scans and photographs of the back of my eye taken so they knew
what they were dealing with. Then in preparation for the procedure, some
numbing eye drops. It's an odd sensation not being able to feel your eyelids
or the skin around your eyes, but that part wasn't uncomfortable.

Next up the consultant held some sort of eyepiece firmly against the surface
of my eyeball and applied a decent amount of pressure to keep it in place.

Then the laser pulses began. Many, many pulses. Each caused an unpleasant
stabbing sensation in my eyeball with a dull ache following it. It wasn't so
much that it was painful — Wikipedia describes this as "stinging" and in
isolation I'd agree with that description. However while this was taking place
my head was in a chin rest with an eyepiece thing pressed against my eyeball
and the knowledge that if I moved unexpectedly then I risked having my vision
destroyed by the laser. And these laser pulses were coming multiple times per
second.

I was doing some grunting at the discomfort of each laser pulse when…

> Me, through gritted teeth: Just do what you need to do.

Another thing I was not prepared for was total blindness during the procedure
and for a few minutes after. He was telling me to look in certain directions,
but my vision had gone completely black due to the laser so I couldn't
actually tell which direction I was looking in.

Then when it was finally over for one eye, I still could not see anything and
due to the anaesthetic could not even tell if my eye was open or not as I
couldn't feel my eyelid. Thankfully that recovered after a couple of minutes
so he could begin on the other eye…

Post procedure was not too bad. It's an outpatient procedure and I was
immediately able to go home on the bus! My eyes just felt tired and took a lot
longer to recover from the dilation drops than they usually do (I have vision
tests several times a year and they always involve dilation drops). A headache
between the temples did force me to go to bed early, but feel fine today.

So… if you have diabetes then blood sugar control is important to help avoid
having to go through something like this. If you lose a genetic lottery then
after decades living with diabetes you may need it anyway, or if you win then
perhaps you never do, but I just suggest doing what you can to improve your
odds.

This is still only the second most unpleasant procedure I've had on my eye
though!
