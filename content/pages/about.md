## The author

Hi, I'm Andy! I'm an end-of-the-Gen-X-cohort computer-toucher and my pronouns
are he/him. I've been professionally touching computers since about 1994,
generally with job titles like "systems administrator", "systems engineer",
"devops", "SRE" and so on. Since 2009 though my full time job has been running
[BitFolk](https://bitfolk.com/), a VM hosting company.

Since 2020 I've also been a
[professional dog sitter](https://dogsitter.services/)! I specialise in
looking after my favourite type of dog â€“
[sighthounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sighthound). Almost all of my dog
sitting clients are [greyhounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound).

On this site I tend to mostly write about technical topics, with the odd
personal post mixed in. Over on my Fediverse account things are skewed more
towards personal posts and stuff about greyhounds! ðŸ˜€

Since 2004 I've lived in London, UK.

## The site

The `strugglers.net` domain is quite old â€”- it was registered in 1998. Back
then most people didn't even have Internet access at home, let alone their own
web sites and email accounts outside of what was provided by their employer or
educational establishment. This site started off being shared by several
people, as even the cost of registering the domain was quite high back then.

I've always been the most dedicated user of this domain but over time the
other users made their own arrangements or just used other social media for
their online presence, until there was just me left using it. Since about 2006
I maintained a blog at [`/~andy/blog/`](https://strugglers.net/~andy/blog/)
but by June 2024 I decided it needed a major refresh. I also decided at the
same time to stop pretending that there are actually any other users here. So,
I took over the root of the domain.

### Software

Starting in 2006 Wordpress was used. The June 2024 migration was to a static
site generator called Zola. The old Wordpress site is now archived and
articles from it are being moved over, their old URIs redirected.

The site is served from a BitFolk VM running [Debian](https://debian.org/)
Linux.
