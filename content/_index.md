New blog, who dis? I've switched blog software and am still moving posts over
from the [old site](https://strugglers.net/~andy/blog/), so you might find
what you were looking for over there.

I decided not to keep the same URL because after about 20 years I figured I
should probably come to terms with the fact that `strugglers.net` is now only
really used by me, for my stuff.
