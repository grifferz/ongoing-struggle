This is the source of the majority of the web site at https://strugglers.net/.

If you're looking at this because you're wanting to fix a simple typo or
something, you'll find the posts under [`content/posts/`](content/posts/).

As of late June 2024 lots of the old posts still exist at
[the legacy blog](https://strugglers.net/~andy/blog/) and are slowly being
migrated over (with redirect) only if they seem at least marginally
interesting.
